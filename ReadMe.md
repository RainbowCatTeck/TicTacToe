Sure! Here are some objectives for creating a beginner Tic Tac Toe game in Python:

1. **Create the Game Board**:
   - Initialize a 3x3 grid to represent the game board.
   - Display the board in a user-friendly format.

2. **Player Input**:
   - Allow two players to take turns.
   - Prompt players to enter their move (row and column).
   - Validate the input to ensure the chosen cell is empty and within the board's range.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - Implement the logic to place 'X' or 'O' on the board based on the player's input.
   - Switch turns between players after each valid move.

4. **Win Condition**:
   - Check for a win condition after each move.
   - Determine if a player has won by having three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

5. **Draw Condition**:
   - Check if the game ends in a draw when all cells are filled and no player has won.

6. **User Interface (Optional)**:
   - Create a simple text-based interface to display the game board and prompt for player input.
   - Optionally, use a graphical user interface (GUI) library like Tkinter for a more interactive experience.

7. **Code Organization**:
   - Organize the code into functions for better readability and maintainability.
   - Use comments to explain the purpose of each function and major code blocks.
